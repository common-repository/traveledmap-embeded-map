Plugin that helps you setup a map of your travel's, using a TraveledMap.com map. Get the list of your trips and
blog posts on a map in 5 minutes.

== Description ==

This plugin will help you creating a map on your blog or website in a few minutes.
Here are all the features of the maps:
 - Display markers (pins) and customize them (color, icon, size)
 - Make each marker clickable, to be able to redirect the user to a blog post or a page of your website
 - The user can move the map, zoom it, and expanded it full screen for a better user experience.
 - Group markers if they are too close to each other (this is automatic, but you can configure how they group)
 - You can show your visited countries thanks to a specific coloration of them.
 - Add pictures to the markers if you need: When the user's mouse is over the marker, a panel will open at the bottom,
 containing the pictures of your trip (or whatever is represented by the pin). The pictures are clickable to be viewed
 as fullscreen, in a gallery.
 - The map colors (oceans, lands, etc.) and displayed information can be customized
 - You can choose a custom default zoom and center for the map, or it can be automatically centered on your markers
 - Finally, you have access to a dedicated interface to create the map, for a better user experience, on
 [TraveledMap](https://www.traveledmap.com/share "Map sharing tool").

Once the map configured on the dedicated interface, you'll just have to get its link and paste it in this plugin's WordPress
block or shortcode.
